TODO 

Long Term
 - parse all type declarations
 - store type decs and file names (db?)
 - use better types unstead of strings
 - calc approximation of type usage? string matching?
 - calc available included types per file
 - use types to parse function declarations


Short Term
 - (done)fix forward declaration error
 - keep track of scope/namespace


do i need to recognise type to tell if something is a function declaration? AA BB(CC);

testing ideas
 - could check if every word is accounted for


check for function:
[type] [optional namespace ::] [name] [(] [variable dec list] [)] [ { or ; ]


check for variable declaration:
type name;
type name([name, ..]);
type name1,name2,name3;
type name = name or value;

method parameters have only uninitialised variable declarations
(type name)
(type name, type name, ..)
(type)
(type, type, type name, ..)

so we have:
methodDec = [(] [type] [optional name] [ , or ) ] [optional methodDec]
